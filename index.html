  <h3>Hi, my name is Vader. I bet you're wondering how I got to be so rad. The answer is simple: I was just born to be cool!</h3>

  <p class="paragrah1">I find that having a nice balance of a heathy diet, plenty of excerise, and a sweet wardrobe add to one's cool factor, but if you really want to add some sweet steeze the real secret is going on adventures.</p>

    <p>I love being a dog in Oregon! This place is great for going on adventures. Astoria, Cannon Beach, and Depoe Bay are some of my favorite places to go for a day at the coast. People give me lots of pats and treats, and running in the sand is a great way to work off the extra calories.</p>
    <p>For a day in the mountains, I'm particularly fond of Tryon Creek. The sheer amount of smells can keep me busy for hours. There are tons of squirrels, rabbits, and birds. I even saw a deer once!</p>
    <p>Whenever I go into the city I make sure to accessorize.</p>

    <p>You want to keep it casual. I like to steal my dad's Carhartt hat. It's perfect for wearing around town.</p>
